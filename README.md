## The Generically Titled, Almost Self-Explanitory App For Tracking Trailer Status On the Dock

Built with React, this app helps keep track of the trailer status on dock doors. The user can update doors with trailer numbers and mark them either empty, breakout, or arrive.

I built this based on the specific needs of the dock at which I work. The current official system doesn't track the trailers in the same way, and as a result, dock leads and supervisors have to write trailers on a printed out list of doors, then when something changes, they cross out the trailer or just make another list. Obviously, this seems inefficient, hence the need for the app. I wanted a way for multiple people to status the trailers in real-time in order to better collaborate.

**Hopefully, I can get a demo version of this up soon.**
